****THIS PROJECT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT**


**This project likely involves developing a holographic display system tailored for medical applications.
The aim could be to create 3D visualizations of medical images (like MRI or CT scans) for enhanced diagnostic purposes.
Implementing such a system would involve hardware setup, software development for image processing and rendering, and possibly integration with existing medical imaging technologies.
Success in this project could revolutionize medical imaging, offering healthcare professionals better insights into patient conditions.**
